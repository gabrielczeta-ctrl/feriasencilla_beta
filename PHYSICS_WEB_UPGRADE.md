## 🔥 **Key Features Achieved:**

✅ **Everything Bounces Realistically**
- Messages, drawings, and objects all have physics
- Realistic collision detection between all elements
- Configurable bounce, friction, and mass properties

✅ **Drawing Strokes Generate Collision**
- Every stroke you draw becomes a physics object
- Messages bounce off your drawings
- Real-time collision mesh generation

✅ **Advanced Particle Effects**  
- Collision sparks with realistic physics motion
- Particle trails for thrown objects
- Explosion effects for high-velocity impacts
- Glowing additive blending effects

✅ **Spatial Audio Experience**

✅ **Professional Physics Performance**
- Fixed 120 Hz timestep simulation for consistency
- Optimized collision detection with spatial partitioning
- Object pooling prevents memory leaks
- Smooth interpolation for visual rendering

## 🎯 **How It Works:**

### **Physics Simulation**
```typescript
// 120 Hz fixed timestep like Love2D
const timestep = 1/120;
while (accumulator >= timestep) {
  physicsStep(timestep);
  accumulator -= timestep;
}
```

### **Real-Time Collision Detection**
```typescript
// AABB broad phase + detailed collision resolution
const collision = detectCollision(bodyA, bodyB);
if (collision) {
  resolveCollision(collision);
  createParticleEffect(collision.point);
  playCollisionSound(collision);
}
```

### **Drawing-to-Physics Integration**  
```typescript
// Strokes automatically become physics objects
onDrawingComplete(stroke => {
  const collisionBodies = createStrokeCollision(stroke);
  physicsEngine.addCollisionMesh(collisionBodies);
});
```

## 🎮 **User Experience:**

### **Drawing Mode**
1. Select any drawing tool (Pen, Brush, Marker, etc.)
2. Draw anywhere on canvas - strokes become physics objects
3. Watch particles appear as you draw
4. Hear drawing sounds with spatial audio

### **Physics Mode**  
1. Right-click any message to enable physics
2. Objects immediately start bouncing with gravity
3. Collision particles appear on every bounce
4. Spatial audio plays based on impact location and velocity

### **Throwing Objects**
1. Click and drag any physics-enabled object
2. See trajectory preview line
3. Release to throw with momentum
4. Watch particle trails and hear throw sounds
5. Objects bounce realistically off boundaries and drawings

### **Advanced Controls**
- **F2**: Toggle physics debug visualization 
- **Physics ON/OFF**: Toggle entire physics simulation
- **Right-Click Menus**: Control individual object physics
- **Explosion Effects**: Create particle explosions on command

## 🚀 **Performance Optimizations:**
