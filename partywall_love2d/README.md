## Configuration

### Physics Settings
```lua
-- In main.lua or physics configuration
physics.gravity = 400        -- Pixels per second squared
physics.timestep = 1/120     -- Fixed timestep for consistency
physics.restitution = 0.8    -- Bounce factor (0-1)
physics.friction = 0.5       -- Surface friction
physics.damping = 0.95       -- Air resistance
```

### Network Settings
```lua
-- WebSocket server configuration
serverUrl = "ws://localhost:8080/ws"
reconnectAttempts = 10
batchInterval = 0.1          -- Message batching (seconds)
heartbeatInterval = 30       -- Connection heartbeat (seconds)
```

### Audio Settings
```lua
-- Volume levels (0.0 - 1.0)
audio.masterVolume = 0.7
audio.sfxVolume = 0.8
audio.musicVolume = 0.5
audio.spatialAudio = true
audio.maxDistance = 1000     -- Spatial audio range
```

## Server Integration

The Love2D client connects to a WebSocket server for multiplayer functionality. Expected message protocol:

```json
// Drawing stroke
{
  "type": "drawing_stroke",
  "data": {
    "id": "stroke_123",
    "tool": "pen",
    "color": [1, 0, 0, 1],
    "size": 5,
    "points": [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...],
    "timestamp": 1234567890,
    "expireAt": 1234571490
  }
}

// Message creation
{
  "type": "post_message",
  "data": {
    "text": "Hello World!",
    "x": 100,
    "y": 200,
    "physics": {"bouncing": true}
  }
}

// Object physics update
{
  "type": "object_update",
  "data": {
    "objectId": "msg_123",
    "updates": {"x": 150, "y": 250, "angle": 0.5}
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Game won't start**
- Ensure Love2D 11.4+ is installed
- Check that all files are in the correct directory structure
- Verify `main.lua` is in the root directory

**Physics not working**
- Check Box2D module is enabled in `conf.lua`
- Verify physics world is created and updated
- Check collision detection callbacks

**Network connection fails**
- Ensure WebSocket server is running on specified port
- Check firewall settings
- Verify server URL in network configuration

**Audio issues**
- Audio files are generated as placeholders
- Check Love2D audio modules are enabled
- Verify system audio output is working

**Performance issues**
- Reduce particle count in effects configuration
- Lower physics timestep if needed
- Disable spatial audio on lower-end systems
- Reduce drawing collision detail

### Debug Features
